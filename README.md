# Design Rationale
I designed the Beyond Career landing page by maintaining a blue-purple color theme for a professional look. I created separate sections for all relevant components: Hero, About, Services, Testimonials, Contact and rendered them in Home component in a single-page layout. I designed the logo using Canva, with an upward arrow symbolizing growth for students in their careers.

# Technical Docs
I chose React.js and Tailwind CSS tech stack for modern UI components. I maintained clean code by separating each section in different JSX components. Ensured smooth scrolling from Navbar to sections and added Social Media handles in Contact section, which redirects to corresponding social media page.

# Deployment Guide
I pushed the frontend folder to a public GitHub repository. Imported the repo to Vercel, which deploys the landing page automatically on every commit. The landing page does not support backend right now.
